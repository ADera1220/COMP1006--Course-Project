      <h4>Project Review</h4>
      <p> Hey there! I was mostly finished this project before this week (july22-26) class on CRUD in php, and I really like the idea of having header and footer separately generated because they are so close, so I added them in. All in all, I think I am getting the hang of php. I had problems when switching from SQL field names, to php variables, to  html id tags and it lead to a lot of confusion. going forward, I think it's best to keep them consistently and distincly named.</p>
